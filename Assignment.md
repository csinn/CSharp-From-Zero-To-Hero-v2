# Homework
Use the `Person` and `Pet` classes from before, but this time also add a SpouseId property. Also add a method: `public void Marry(Person other person)` which marries two people (hint- requirement 6 below).

Create an endpoint for each operation:

1. ~~Add person~~
2. ~~Add a pet to an existing person~~
3. ~~Remove person~~
4. ~~Remove pet from an existing person~~
5. ~~Update an existing person data~~
6. ~~Marry two people~~

If an operation is not possible, return an appropriate HTTP status code. Demonstrate each request and response using Postman.
