# From Zero To Hero

## The vision

"Programming is hard". Yes, but not harder than running a marathon for a person who has never run. It's not harder than 
building a house if you never built one. Programming is hard only until you practice it (like any other skill). 
I would like to invite you to learn programming following this course. 
Ignite passion for finding little miracles in code every day ðŸ™‚
